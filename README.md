# Huey Long 1936 - The Campaign Trail
A mod for The New Campaign Trail, set in an alternate 1936, featuring Huey Long as the Democratic Nominee. It's based on the 1932 mod, but with a slightly closer race. Huey Long and all of his running mates are finished, although I will update this for feedback. Alf Landon and his running mates will be added eventually.

# How To Play
- First, head over here to [https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html](https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html). At the bottom right, you'll see a mod loader button.
- Second, you're going to need to copy 2 of the .json files. First, copy all the text in hueylong-code1.json and paste it in the box named "Code Set 1". 
- The Second Box depends on the running mate you wish to play as. You can either choose John Garner (incumbent Vice President), Franklin D. Roosevelt (incumbent President), or Henry A. Wallace (future Vice President and current Secretary of Agriculture.) Copy all the text from long-garner.json, long-roosevelt.json, or long-wallace.json and put it into "Code Set 2".
- Click submit, and the first scenario should be the 1936B mod. Select the candidate and running mate based on the .json files you pasted, and have fun!
# FAQ
- **There's plans for a Alf Landon scenario, right?**

~~Of course. However, as this is my first mod, my goal is to release what I have and take any feedback to ensure everything is the best it can be. I don't have a set release date for Alf Landon, as schoolwork often gets in the way, but I'm sure it'll be released within the next few months.~~

Yes, and it's out now. 

- **Is there a regular 1936 mod?**

Not as of writing this, although once I finish this mod, I think I will make a regular 1936 mod. 

- **This mod sucks/I have a bug/I wanna give my thoughts.**

You can leave any comments or concerns at my Discord, Astronomical#3005. I'm also in [The Campaign Trail Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CfS6yTtjZj), which if you haven't joined yet, what's wrong with you? 

# Thanks
Shoutout to PizzaHut for the 1932 mod and for playtesting, couldn't have done this without them. Also big shoutout to Snoo and Bruh/Senator Cringe, they both playtested this mod awhile ago. 

Sorry for taking so long to release this.
