# Huey Long 1936 - The Campaign Trail
A mod for The New Campaign Trail, set in an alternate 1936, featuring Huey Long as the Democratic Nominee. It's based on the 1932 mod, but with a slightly closer race. Huey Long and all of his running mates are finished, although I will update this for feedback. Alf Landon and his running mates will be added eventually.

# How To Play
- Before I begin, both of these mods are available in the mod loader, so there's now two ways to play it.
- Option 1 is loading the mods via the mod loader. 
- First, head over here to [https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html](https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html). At the bottom right, you'll see a mod loader button.
- You'll then want to click on the loader, and go to the dropdown box.
- Find the candidate and running mate you want to play as. This mod is listed as "1936b" in the mod loader. 
- For Huey Long, you can either choose...
    * John Garner (incumbent Vice President)
    * Franklin D. Roosevelt (incumbent President)
    * Henry A. Wallace (future Vice President and current Secretary of Agriculture.) 
 - For Alf Landon, you can either choose....
    * Frank Knox (Newspaper Editor)
    * Charles McNary (Senate Minority Leader)
    * Style Bridges (Future Senator from New Hampshire in the OTL and incumbent Governor of New Hampshire.)
- Option 2 is to manually submit Codes 1 and 2, but with these files being in the mod loader, it's a bit redundant. Regardless, I will keep this tutorial for general use on loading mods.
- First, head over here to [https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html](https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/newcampaigntrail/www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/index.html). At the bottom right, you'll see a mod loader button.
- Second, you're going to need to copy 2 of the .json files. First, copy all the text in hueylong-code1.json and paste it in the box named "Code Set 1". 
- The Second Box depends on the running mate you wish to play as. 
- For Huey Long, you can either choose...
    * John Garner (incumbent Vice President)
    * Franklin D. Roosevelt (incumbent President)
    * Henry A. Wallace (future Vice President and current Secretary of Agriculture.) 
- Copy all the text from long-garner.json, long-roosevelt.json, or long-wallace.json and put it into "Code Set 2". 
- For Alf Landon, you can either choose....
    * Frank Knox (Newspaper Editor)
    * Charles McNary (Senate Minority Leader)
    * Style Bridges (Future Senator from New Hampshire in the OTL and incumbent Governor of New Hampshire.)
- Copy all the text from landon-knox.json, landon-mcnary.json, or landon-bridges.json and put it into "Code Set 2".
- Click submit, and the first scenario should be the 1936B mod. Select the candidate and running mate based on the .json files you pasted, and have fun!
# FAQ
- **There's plans for a Alf Landon scenario, right?**

~~Of course. However, as this is my first mod, my goal is to release what I have and take any feedback to ensure everything is the best it can be. I don't have a set release date for Alf Landon, as schoolwork often gets in the way, but I'm sure it'll be released within the next few months.~~

Yes, and it's out now. 

- **Is there a regular 1936 mod?**

Not as of writing this, ~~although once I finish this mod, I think I will make a regular 1936 mod.~~ but I am now working on an 1936 mod. 

- **This mod sucks/I have a bug/I wanna give my thoughts.**

You can leave any comments or concerns at my Discord, Astronomical#3005. I'm also in [The Campaign Trail Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CfS6yTtjZj), which if you haven't joined yet, what's wrong with you? 

# Thanks
Shoutout to PizzaHut for the 1932 mod and for playtesting, couldn't have done this without them. Also big shoutout to Snoo and Bruh/Senator Cringe, they both playtested this mod awhile ago. 

Sorry for taking so long to release this.
